= Why doesn't XML_GRDDL work with Flickr / Upcoming / My site Work? =
Symptoms:
  * Other microformat parsers just work
  * XML_GRDDL doesn't
  * You know the site as microformatted information


It's either a configuration setting:

{{{
$options = array(
'tidy' => true,                         //Use HTML Tidy to get valid xml/xhtml
'prettify' => true,                  
'documentTransformations' => true,   
'namespaceTransformations' => true, 
'htmlTransformations' => true,      
'htmlProfileTransformations' => true);  //Search for microformat profiles
}}}
(Recommended default configuration for real-world usage)

Or the site doesn't provide a reliable //head[@profile].

They need to publish something like:
{{{
<html>
  <head profile="http://www.w3.org/2006/03/hcard
                 http://dannyayers.com/microformats/hcalendar-profile
                 http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/cardcaletc">
    <!-- Snip -->
  </head>
  <!-- Snip -->
</html>
}}}

... and in turn, those profiles need to have an appropriate profileTransformation.

*Note* I'm thinking about ways to fix this situation, from pre-made site templates or simply pre-loading some transformations.

= Does XML_GRDDL pass all GRDDL tests? =
No. Currently, 0.0.3 will fail content negotiation tests and xml:base related tests.

It's close, but not quite there.
